## Code Style

Having a style guide makes a code base feel neat. It gives the impression of a team working well together towards a common goal, rather than individual developers working frantically and without purpose.

Working in a well-organized code base is like cooking in a clean kitchen. If things feel messy, itâ€™s easy not to treat it with respect. If the formatting feels sloppy, it will tempt you to also be sloppy when it comes to readability, dependency management, and testing.

As our codebase grows, we need to be able to maintain the codebase without much frustration and one of the keys is following a appropriate coding style.
