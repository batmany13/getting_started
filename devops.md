### Our Deployment Model

* Each branch gets built on Semaphore and tested
* Merge branch into master after a PR
* Heroku it is then "automatically" deployed into production

### Team Collaboration

We pretty much use slack for most of inter-team communications so you'll notice a couple of channels to be aware of

* [#devy](https://brighterlink.slack.com/archives/devy) - this is pretty much where all of our various tool communications go, so anything from CI to CD to Exceptions go here    
* [#critical](https://brighterlink.slack.com/archives/critical) - these are critical system alerts, and most likely a "system" down type scenario
