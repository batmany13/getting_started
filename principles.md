## Our Core Values

At Brightergy, we have 3 main core values (listed below), and it fits nicely with many philosophies here within the tech team, here are our straightforward simple ideals

 * __Fail (or Succeed) Fast__ - we can't be afraid to try new technologies, techniques, and if it doesn't work, we fix it fast and learn from it.  Failures are learning oppurtunities and leads to success (BB, FC)
 * __No Blame__ - as part of failing fast, we don't point fingers, we solve problems, this ensures we have a culture of executing without fear (BB, HP)
 * __Collaborate__ - there are no silos, within our teams and with other departments, the only way we win is to work together for the betterment of our customers (FC, HP)
 * __Continuous Improvement__ - we have to always be getting better, technology moves extremely fast, and a powerful tool today, maybe obselete in a short period of time.  But it doesn't have to just be big things, refactoring code, cleaning up lint errors all is part of continuous imporvement.  (FC, HP)
 * __Care about your craft__ - see a bug that needs fixing, see a broken test, a process that needs improving?  Then fix it, care that what you do is done right, and even though it won't be perfect the first time (which it should almost never be), you care about making it better (HP)
 * __Be Consistent__ - follow [conventions](http://www.phoenixframework.org/), [standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), [style guides](code_style.md) are all good things, as it makes it easier to collaborate with teammates and allows us to execute faster as we follow well known systems and frameworks (HP)

###Be bold (BB)
Reimagining energy means taking risks and challenging the status quo. We’re trailblazers defining a new industry and we embrace this with confidence. 

###Fiercely compete (FC)
We compete together for our customers and employees, against the competition, and to better ourselves. As a team, we do whatever it takes to make Brightergy a success, even when it’s hard.

###Have passion (HP)
We perform with purpose, pride, and a positive attitude. We’re constantly pushing ourselves to learn more and be better.
