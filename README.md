# Getting started

Welcome to the brighterlink GitHub repository.  This is where all of our code is housed, and this is a quick start guide for you to get you quickly acquainted with our system

## Development Methodology and Tools

We use a Continuous Delivery model here, with weekly "Milestone" sprints.  The idea here is, we have a weekly "goal" that we want to hit, but we're pushing code to production constantly, so if we need to fix bugs, or clean up something, we can do it without waiting for an official "release".

[GitHub](https://github.com/Brightergy) - Our code repo, DUH!   
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Brightergy/brighterlink_io/issues) - We track our bugs here   
[Trello](https://trello.com/brightergy2) - Our sprint boards, we use this with GitHub Issues   
[Slack](https://brighterlink.slack.com) - This is for team collaboration   
[Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/) - Continuous Integration for testing our builds

## Architecture

We have two main components in our system, our "front end" and our "back end".  The front end is our user interface, and it connects to the backend via Websockets and REST apis.
