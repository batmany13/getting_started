Welcome to Brightergy's R&D team, primarily responsible for building the Brighterlink Platform.  This is your one stop shop for getting to know our system, tools, processes and technology better.

*NOTE : This workspace is always changing to reflect our latest practices and technologies*

### Development Philosphy

We use a (semi) Continuous Delivery model here, with near constant delivery to production, structured by weekly sprints and monthly milestones (more detail below).  The idea here is, we have a milestone with some key high level points, then break it down to digestable weekly sprints, and then push code to production continuously as we build up the systems.  This allows us to continuously improve our system without waiting for an official "release".

[Design Thinking](ux.md)
[Code Style](code_style.md)   

### DevOps Culture

We have a deeply ingrained DevOps culture here, it doesn't mean you have to be an expert on everything, but it means you should care and value all the parts of delivery our product, from the code all the way to running in production and getting customer feedback.

### Architecture

We have three main components in our system, our "front end",  our "back end APIs" and our device code.  The front end is our user interface, and it connects to the backend via Websockets and REST apis.
