Welcome to Brightergy's R&D team, primarily responsible for building the Brighterlink Platform.  This is your one stop shop for getting to know our system, tools, processes and technology better.

### Development Philosphy

We use a Continuous Delivery model here, with weekly "Milestone" sprints (more detail below).  The idea here is, we have a weekly "goal" that we want to hit, but we're pushing code to production constantly, so if we need to fix bugs, or clean up something, we can do it without waiting for an official "release".

### DevOps Culture

We have a deeply ingrained DevOps culture here, it doesn't mean you have to be an expert on everything, but it means you should care and value all the parts of delivery our product, from the code all the way to running in production and getting customer feedback.

### Architecture

We have three main components in our system, our "front end",  our "back end APIs" and our device code.  The front end is our user interface, and it connects to the backend via Websockets and REST apis.
